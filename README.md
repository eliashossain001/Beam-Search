# Beam-search-decoding
This repository contains time-step wise word/phoneme predictions (n-best sequences and word tokens) using the beam search decoding algorithm.

# File description

Four files, including n best sequence.py, n best token.py, n best token lp.py, and greedy token.py, can be found in this repository. The first file is called n best sequence.py, and it is used to find the n best sequences for each time step. The information has served as proof of concept. The second program is n best token.py, which uses the beam search decoding algorithm to get the n-best word token at each time step. Lastly, the length penalty concepts used in n best token lp.py are vital and a crucial component of the beam search process. In conclusion, greedy token.py uses the greedy search decoding algorithm's principles in order to do comparative analysis.
